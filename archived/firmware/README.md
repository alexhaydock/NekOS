# NekOS Firmware

This is the archived non-Nix (non-reproducible) firmware build that uses Podman.

It is preserved for archival's sake but all future NekOS firmware development will use Nix for reproducibility.

This version of the firmware build process also previously built populated JSON-based EFI variable stores. That has been moved into the `efivars` step.
